# Corrupting data

Gecko comes with a lot of built-in functions that corrupt data by applying errors that one might find in the real world.
Any function that takes in and returns a [Pandas series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) is considered a corruptor function in Gecko.

```py
import pandas as pd

def corruptor_func(srs: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
    srs_out = srs.copy()
    # ... perform mutations on the copy ...
    return srs_out
```

Gecko provides functions for introducing typographic, phonetic and other errors.
These functions are exposed in Gecko's `corruptor` module.

## Available corruptors

### Keyboard typos

One of the most common sources for typos are adjacent keys on a keyboard.
Gecko supports loading of keyboard layouts and applying typos based on them.
Currently, keyboard layouts must be provided as an XML file from the [Unicode CLDR repository](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr).
Gecko parses these files and determines all neighboring keys of each key, as well as their variants with and without ++shift++ pressed.

!!! warning

    As of Unicode CLDR keyboard specification is under a major redesign as of release 44.
    Support will be added as soon as the specification is finalized.
    For now, please retrieve CLDR keyboard files from a release tagged 43 or earlier.
    The examples in this documentation use files from the CLDR release 43.

[Download the German keyboard layout from the CLDR repository](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/release-43/keyboards/windows/de-t-k0-windows.xml).
The corresponding corruptor function is called `with_cldr_keymap_file`.
Point the corruptor to the file you just downloaded.
In the following example, one character in each word is substituted by another neighboring character on the German keyboard.

```py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from gecko import corruptor

rng = np.random.default_rng(3141)
kb_corruptor = corruptor.with_cldr_keymap_file(
    "./de-t-k0-windows.xml",
    rng=rng
)
srs = pd.Series(["apple", "banana", "clementine"])
print(kb_corruptor(srs))
# => ["spple", "banany", "cldmentine"]
```

By default, this corruptor considers all possible neighboring keys for each key.
If you want to constrain typos to a certain set of characters, you can pass an optional string of characters to this corruptor.
One such example is to limit the corruptor to digits when manipulating a series of numbers that are broken up by non-digit characters.
The following snippet avoids the substitution of hyphens by specifying that only digits may be manipulated.

```py
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import string

from gecko import corruptor

rng = np.random.default_rng(2718)
kb_corruptor = corruptor.with_cldr_keymap_file(
    "./de-t-k0-windows.xml",
    charset=string.digits,
    rng=rng
)
srs = pd.Series(["123-456-789", "727-727-727", "294-753-618"])
print(kb_corruptor(srs))
# => ["122-456-789", "827-727-727", "294-753-628"]
```

### Phonetic errors

One of the most challenging error sources to model are phonetic errors.
These are words that sound the same but are written differently.

In German, for example, "ß" can almost always be replaced with "ss" and still have the word that it's in sound the same.
Whether one writes "Straße" or "Strasse" does not matter as far as pronunciation is concerned.
The same holds for "dt" and "tt" at the end of a word, since both reflect a hard "t" sound.
One can derive rules from similarly sounding character sequences.

Gecko offers a method for modelling these rules and introducing phonetic errors based on them.
A phonetic rule in Gecko consists of a source pattern ("ß", "dt"), a target pattern ("ss", "tt") and positional flags.
The flags determine whether this rule applies at the start (`^`), in the middle (`_`) or the end (`$`) of a word.
These flags can be freely combined.
The absence of a positional flag implies that a rule can be applied anywhere in a string.
Taking the example from above, a suitable rule table could look like this.

=== "CSV"

    ```csv
    source,target,flags
    ß,ss,
    dt,tt,$
    ```

=== "Table"
    
    | **Source** | **Target** | **Flags** |
    | :-- | :-- | --: |
    | ß | ss | |
    | dt | tt | $ |

Gecko exposes the `with_phonetic_replacement_table` function to handle these types of tables.
The signature is similar to that of `with_replacement_table`.

```py
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

from geco import corruptor

rng = np.random.default_rng(8844167)

phonetic_corruptor = corruptor.with_phonetic_replacement_table(
    "./phonetic-rules-de.csv",
    header=True,
    source_column="source",
    target_column="target",
    flags_column="flags",
    rng=rng,
)

srs = pd.Series(["straße", "stadt", "schießen"])
print(phonetic_corruptor(srs))
# => ["strasse", "statt", "schiessen"]
```

### Missing values

A textual representation of a "missing value" is sometimes used to clearly indicate that a blank or an empty value is to be interpreted as a missing piece of information.
In datasets sourced from large databases, this "missing value" might consist of characters that do not adhere to a table or column schema.
A simple example would be `###_MISSING_###` in place of a person's date of birth, since it does not conform to any common date format and consists entirely of letters and special characters. 

Gecko provides the function `with_missing_value` which replaces certain values within a series with a custom "missing value".
The corruptor replaces either empty, blank or all strings within a series depending on the defined strategy.
This is best explained by a few examples.

Gecko considers strings to be "empty" when their length is zero.
Strings with whitespaces will be left as-is.

```py
import pandas as pd

from gecko import corruptor

missing_corruptor = corruptor.with_missing_value(
    "###_MISSING_###", 
    strategy="empty"
)
srs = pd.Series(["apple", "   ", ""])
print(missing_corruptor(srs))
# => ["apple", "   ", "###_MISSING_###"]
```

Gecko considers strings to be "blank" when their length is zero after trimming all leading and trailing whitespaces.
This is the default behavior of this corruptor.

```py
import pandas as pd

from gecko import corruptor

missing_corruptor = corruptor.with_missing_value(
    "###_MISSING_###", 
    strategy="blank"
)
srs = pd.Series(["apple", "   ", ""])
print(missing_corruptor(srs))
# => ["apple", "###_MISSING_###", "###_MISSING_###"]
```

The "nuclear" option is to replace all strings within a series with the "missing value".

```py
import pandas as pd

from gecko import corruptor

missing_corruptor = corruptor.with_missing_value(
    "###_MISSING_###", 
    strategy="all"
)
srs = pd.Series(["apple", "   ", ""])
print(missing_corruptor(srs))
# => ["###_MISSING_###", "###_MISSING_###", "###_MISSING_###"]
```
